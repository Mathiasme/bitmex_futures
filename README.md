# bitmex_futures

Python script to pull data from psql and simulate an open leveraged bitmex future. 
It lets you pick a leverage.
NbreDeJoursMicro being the duration of the future contract in days.
NbreDeJoursMacro being the the period on which you want the script to run in days from the "DateDepart".

You'll need prices data from the past years in a database (I went with postgres). They are available from the csv in the repo.





You can contact me on Twitter @mathiasdlb if you need help with the script :)
